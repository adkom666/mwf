            In networking, one of the devices creates a group and is its owner, while other devices join this group. 
            On all devices of the group, the rhythm set by the group owner sounds. 
            If a member of the group, who is not the owner of it, starts his metronome or plays the rhythm in his editor, 
            he will automatically disjoin from the group.

            To join to group, click the &quot;Join To Group&quot; button and wait until at least one group is found. 
            After that you will see a screen with a list of detected groups. 
            Select the desired group and click the &quot;Join&quot; button. 
            The &quot;Disjoin&quot; button causes disjoint, the screen does not change. 
            The &quot;Initial State&quot; button leads to a return to the previous screen. 
            In this case, if the device is in any group, a disjoint occurs.
